# Car-DNN-Classifier-in-TensorFlow
### The Car ðŸš—ðŸš— ðŸ˜ƒ 
### This Car data for work - DNN Classifier in TensorFlow 
#### About the Columns 

- buying = Is there an interest in buying?
- maint = Car needs maintenance
- doors = The number of car doors 
- persons = The number of car passenger 
- lug_boot= The size luggage
- safety = Safety rate in the car
